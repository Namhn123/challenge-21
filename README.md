# 21 MERN: Book Search Engine

Our object is to refactor already working code and use useQuery and useMutation. We first need to create typeDefs, using the models as a reference. Then we need a resolver which is the functionality for all the functions in typeDef. Then on the client side, we need to create mutations and queries. We remove the uses of useEffect and replace them with useQuery and useMutation.
